# MediaDB-Final
Final project for Adv. Database Class

## What is it?
This php project required us to create a media database using sql, and then we had to create a website utilizing php to be able to search and add to the database.

## How did I do?
I got a perfect score on the final assignment, however there is one issue in particular that I would like to address at somepoint.

### Issues/Upcoming Changes
One of the functionalities of this project was to allow new data to be entered, and currently it is `functional`. However, it only works once, and then it doesn't update the database properly after the first time.
